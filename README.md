##Chicago Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing and querying multiple datasets related to Chicago, including Chicago Crime Data, Chicago Census Data, and Chicago Public Schools Data. The data is loaded into an SQLite database to facilitate complex queries and analysis. The project demonstrates how to work with large datasets using SQL and Python (Pandas) for data extraction, transformation, and visualization.

Key Features:
SQLite Database Integration: All datasets are stored in an SQLite database (FinalDB.db), which makes querying the data fast and efficient.

SQL Queries: SQL queries are used to analyze data, such as finding crime trends, listing community areas with specific characteristics, and calculating statistics such as average safety scores for schools.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: The data was cleaned and processed using SQL queries and Python, handling missing data, and performing necessary transformations for proper analysis.

Community Area & Crime Data Analysis: The project includes identifying the most crime-prone community areas, finding the most frequent crimes, and analyzing the socioeconomic indicators of these areas.

Public School Data Analysis: The analysis of Chicago public schools includes safety scores and their relationship to other factors like school type and community involvement.

Technologies Used:
Python: For data manipulation using Pandas.

SQL: For querying the SQLite database.

SQLite: A lightweight database to store and manage the datasets.

Datasets:
Chicago Crime Data: Contains detailed records of reported crimes in Chicago.

Chicago Census Data: Provides demographic and socioeconomic data of various community areas in Chicago.

Chicago Public Schools Data: Contains information about public schools, including their performance, safety scores, and other metrics.

Examples of Analysis:
Querying crime data to find cases involving minors or specific types of crime (e.g., kidnapping, liquor law violations).

Listing community areas with the highest poverty rates or the most crime.

Analyzing school safety scores by school type.

Determining which community areas have the highest hardship index or per capita income.
